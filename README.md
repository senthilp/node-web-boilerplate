It is a boilerplate for node + expressjs + dustjs + mocha.

Quick Start
-----
Assume you have cloned the repository locally and get into the repo folder.

You can run the server in the boilerplate
```
make clean install server (the first time)
or
make server
Access http://localhost:8080/
```

You can run the mocha unit testing alone
```
npm install -g mocha (if mocha not installed)
make clean install test (the first time)
or
make test
```
